Saturday hot day, taking rosy for lunch...
going near the water
early morning lab - having issues w functions
__
Lots of changes, var, numerical operators, sting, arrays, conditionals, loops, object, function, class - OOP concepts - class project 


/javascript

const charArray = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j','k','l','m','n','o','p','q','r','s','t','u','v','w','x','y','z'];


function printForward (charArray) {
    for (i = 0; i < charArray.length; i++) {
        console.log(charArray[i]);
    }
}

//print backard
for (i = charArray.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if ( i % 2 == 0 ) {
        console.log(charArray[i]);
    }

}


#1 write functions forward and backward
#2 print within each function the content of the array
#3 print as returned array from the functions
#4 pass arrays by pointers
